<b>Comments:</b> Both registration and login forms have validation. I like how you added the extra button at the bottom for users to sign up on the registration page. VERY CREATIVE! I also like the "forgot password" addition on the login page. Everything works as it should and I really liked the gradient you used for your background.Overall, great job.<br>
